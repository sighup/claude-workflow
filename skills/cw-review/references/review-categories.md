## Review Categories

#### Category A: Correctness (Blocking)

- Logic errors, off-by-one, wrong conditions
- Missing error handling at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Race conditions or concurrency issues
- Incorrect data transformations
- Missing null/undefined checks where data could be absent

#### Category B: Security (Blocking)

- SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, secrets
- Missing authentication or authorization checks
- Insecure data handling (logging PII, exposing internals)
- Path traversal or file inclusion vulnerabilities
- Unsafe deserialization

#### Category C: Spec Compliance (Blocking)

- Requirements from the spec that were missed or incorrectly implemented
- Behavior that contradicts spec intent
- Missing functionality described in demoable units

#### Category D: Quality (Advisory)

- Dead code or unreachable branches
- Overly complex logic that could be simplified
- Missing edge case handling
- Performance concerns (N+1 queries, unnecessary loops)
- Inconsistency with repository patterns

## Severity Guidelines

| Category | Creates FIX Task | Blocks Merge |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| A: Correctness bug | Yes | Yes |
| B: Security vulnerability | Yes | Yes |
| C: Missing spec requirement | Yes | Yes |
| D: Quality/style note | No | No |

**Do NOT create FIX tasks for:**
- Code style preferences already handled by linters
- Minor naming disagreements
- "I would have done it differently" observations
- Test code (tests are the oracle)
- Documentation gaps (unless spec requires it)
